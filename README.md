# RayTracer

This Git Repo holds code for a raytracer I wrote in my Raytracing class. Multiple rays are cast into a scene and apply different colors to an array of pixels deppending on what it hits. 

raytrace.cpp/h contains the code to control how many rays are cast and to save the pictures out to an image file. 

raytime.cpp/h contains the code for intersection between various shapes to make the raytracer as efficient as possible. It also contains code to apply different materials based on what an object is made out of i.e. reflective or translucent. 

Below is an image of what a final output of the raytracer could be.
